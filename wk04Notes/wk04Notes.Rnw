\section{Brief Review}
We ended last time with the perpetration of sin in Cain's murder of Abel.
I received two good questions after class that I want to address. Then we
will look at the continued effects of sin in Adam's descendants which prompt
God to display both His grace and wrath in the time of Noah. We will see
Noah's descendants continue to struggle with sin, causing God to intervene
to disrupt at Babel.

I also want to slow down a bit and take time for questions and discussion.
The time limitations will require us to focus more selectively. For those
of you who want to read ahead, after we finish Noah, we will look at
the call of Abram in Gen 12--13.

\subsection{Question 1}
Bill asked about the origin of the term \emph{noetic}. It comes from the
Greek word for `mind' or `intellect'. The idea is that man's intellect is
fallen, his mind is darkened, and he has become a fool. People have long
recognized that the consumption of alcohol can make what is later seen
as a really foolish decision seem like a good idea at the time. A song writer
described this as ``beer goggles''. We often fail to recognize that fallen
man views the world through ``sin goggles'' until God renews his mind.

A great example is in Gen 4:9 where Cain responds to God's question, ``Where
is your brother, Abel?'' with a lie and a snide remark: ``I do not know,
am I my brother's keeper?''
God's mercy and restraint is remarkable\ldots 

\subsection{Question 2}
Ted Larter asked the question that is on all our minds: ``Why would God permit
this?''

This is where we need to let Scripture interpret Scripture. In Eph 1:4-6, Paul
makes it clear that redemption of sinful man by the death of Christ was God's
plan from ``before the foundation of the world'' -- that is before creation.
This was God's ``Plan A'' -- not a case of taking lemons and making lemonade.

Paul gives us a glimpse of God's thinking in Rom 9:22-24

\begin{quotation}
$^{22}$What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power,
has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,
$^{23}$in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy,
which he has prepared beforehand for glory -- $^{24}$even us whom he has
called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles? [Ro~9:22--24,~ESV]
\end{quotation}

Paul's answer is that God put up with the revulsion of sin to demonstrate
all His attributes to His people - with whom He desires an everlasting
relationship. We can't begin to comprehend His grace and mercy without
understanding the wretched depravity from which He redeemed us and the
tremendous cost of that redemption.

\section{Fast forward through 10 generations}

Noah is the \red{tenth} generation from Adam. This is one place we
need to get selective. Besides Noah, the text doesn't say much about
these patriarchs beyond that most lived longer than 900 years. One
notable exception is Enoch.

\subsection{Enoch's relationship with God}
\begin{quotation}
$^{22}$Enoch walked with God after he fathered Methuselah 300 years
and had other sons and daughters. $^{23}$Thus all the days of Enoch
were 365 years. $^{24}$Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for
God took him. [Ge~5:22--24, ESV].
\end{quotation}

The writer to the Hebrews provides the following interpretation

\begin{quotation}
$^{5}$By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death,
and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was
taken he was commended as having pleased God. [Heb 11:5, ESV].
\end{quotation}

Note that the decrease in lifespan from Methuselah (969) to Lamech (739)
suggests that both perished in the Flood.

\section{God's assessment of man}

The general spiritual state at this time can only be described as abysmal.
God is livid.

\begin{quotation}
$^{5}$The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
that \red{every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.}
$^{6}$And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it
grieved him to his heart. $^{7}$So the LORD said, ``I will blot out man whom
I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping
things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.''
[Ge~6:5--7,~ESV]).
\end{quotation}


This judgement is justified. We would not be here if God had not made
one other statement:

\begin{quotation}
$^{8}$But Noah found favor (\emph{hen}, grace) in the eyes of the LORD. [Ge~6:8,~ESV]
\end{quotation}

\section{Noah's character and relationship with God}

In Ge 6:9, God describes Noah's character in a thesis statement for
this chapter

\begin{quotation}
$^{9}$\ldots Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God. [Ge 6:9, ESV]
\end{quotation}

As we continue, ask yourself, ``\red{How/Why was Noah righteous?}''

\subsection{God's revelation to Noah}

\begin{itemize}
  \item God reveals His plan to flood the Earth and why (Gen 6:12-13)
  \item God commands Noah to build a massive Ark (Gen 6:14-17)
  \item God explains His covenant of deliverance (Gen 6:18-21)
\end{itemize}

God describes Noah's response succinctly in v 22.

\begin{quotation}
$^{22}$Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him. [Ge 6:22, ESV]
\end{quotation}

\subsection{Noah's response after deliverance Gen 8:20-22}

God gives us a glimpse into Noah's heart in his response to
deliverance

\begin{quotation}
$^{20}$Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and took some of every
clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings
on the altar. $^{21}$And when the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, the
LORD said in his heart, ``I will never again curse the ground because
of man, for the intention of manâ€™s heart is evil from his youth.
Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as
I have done. $^{22}$While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest,
cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.''
[Ge 8:20--22, ESV]
\end{quotation}

God saw Noah's response in faith and made a covenant with him and
his descendants -- \red{in spite of man's sinful nature}.

The writer to the Hebrews (11:7) helps us understand Noah's righteousness.

\begin{quotation}
$^{7}$By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as
yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving
of his household. By this he condemned the world and \red{became an
heir of the righteousness that comes by faith}. [Heb 11:7, ESV]
\end{quotation}

\subsection{The charge to Noah and his descendants Gen 9:1-17}

Some key points

\begin{itemize}
  \item The command to multiply and subdue the earth -- as it's
  stewards (\red{Gen 9:1-4})
  \item Establishes the death penalty for murder and expects
  human government to administer as His representative (\red{Gen 9:5-6})
  \item Provides the rainbow as a symbol of His covenant not to
  again destroy all life by flood (\red{Gen 9:7-17}) 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The response of Noah and his descendants Gen 9:18-11:31}

Here we see further examples of the noetic effects of sin and yet
another downward spiral. The first recorded incident was the poor
judgement of Noah's son Ham when Noah passed out after consuming
too much wine (\red{Gen 9:21-22}). This caused significant family turmoil.

The rapid decline continued, culminating in God's intervention at Babel.

\begin{quotation}
$^{4}$Then they said, ``Come, let us build \red{ourselves} a city and a tower
with its top in the heavens, and let us make a \red{name for ourselves},
lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.'' [Ge 11:4, ESV]
\end{quotation}

Note how this was problematic for several reasons

\begin{itemize}
  \item They ignore God's command to fill and subdue the earth.
  \item Their plan is for their glory, not God's
  \item They have lost all sight of their job as God's stewards.
\end{itemize}

God intervenes to stop this epic fail.
