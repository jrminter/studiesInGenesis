\section{Introduction}

Last week we ended with God's intervention to stop man's sin at Babel.
This week we will begin our study of Abraham, looking at his call by
God in Gen 12 and 13. Next time we will consider Abram, Melchizedek,
and the covenant from Gen 14--15 if you want to read ahead.

\subsection{Genealogy of Abram: Gen 11:10--26}
Gen 11:10--26 Records the genealogy from Noah's son Shem to Abram. We
will not dwell on these genealogies, but we will pause for a moment
and consider the question:

\red{Q:} Why are these genealogies at all relevant to the Gospel
of Christ?

\red{A:} We saw the \emph{protoevangel} -- the first hint of the Gospel
-- in Gen 3:15. Christ will be a descendant of Eve. We will see another
in Gen 12:3. And in Jer 23:5 we see that the Christ will be a descendant
of David. These genealogies are important to establish Jesus' claim to
be the Messiah.

\subsection{Abram's family history: Gen 11:27-32}

The patriarchs are all real people. It is too easy to consider them
larger than life and view them through rose colored glasses. This was
an issue for the Jews of Christ's day. We view U.S. presidents like
Washington and Lincoln in the same way. Here we get a hint that
Abram's life was complicated by family dynamics.

\section{The call of Abram: Gen 12:1--9}

\red{Note:} Get someone to read this passage

This section summarizes the key points: God called Abram and made bold
promises to him. Abram obeyed. All this is true.

\subsection{Some geographical notes to help you get your bearings}

\begin{itemize}
\item \red{Ur of the Chaldeans} was near Baghdad, Iraq.
\item \red{Haran} was northwest of Ur, in southern Turkey near the
Syrian border. It appeared to be approximately midway between the Tigris
and Euphrates rivers (both reasonable trade routes), so they could have
taken either route. This was a logical stop on the way to modern Israel
because it avoided the direct route through the Arabian desert.
\item \red{Hebron} was on the West Bank, 19 miles south of Jerusalem.
\item Abram's wanderings, including the trip to Egypt are thought to
have totaled approximately 1500 miles.

\end{itemize}

Establishing the
timeline is a bit more complicated and there are hints to some 
complicated family dynamics. Happily, the Scriptures tell us what
we need to know\ldots

\subsection{Hints at a timeline issue}

\red{Q:} How many of your bibles have a footnote at Gen 12:1? What does it say?

\end{tabular}

Let's let Scripture interpret Scripture

\begin{quotation}
``$^{7}$I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.'' [\red{Gen~15:7}, ESV]
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
  ``\ldots $^{2}$The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when
  he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, $^{3}$and said to
  him, `Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the
  land that I will show you.' $^{4}$Then he went out from the land of
  the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God
  removed him from there into this land in which you are now
  living. $^{5}$Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's
  length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his
  offspring after him, though he had no child.'' [\red{Acts~7:2--5},
  ESV] (Stephen's Sermon)
\end{quotation}

\red{Q:} What family dynamics do you think were going on that affected
Abram's obedience to God's call?

There is an interesting exchange between Jesus and some disciples
recorded in \red{Luke 9:57-60}

\begin{quotation}
$^{57}$As they were going along the road, someone said to him, ``I will
follow you wherever you go.'' $^{58}$And Jesus said to him, ``Foxes have
holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere
to lay his head.'' $^{59}$To another he said, ``Follow me.'' But he
said, ``Lord, let me first go and bury my father.'' $^{60}$And Jesus
said to him, ``Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go
and proclaim the kingdom of God.'' [Lk~9:57--60, ESV]
\end{quotation}

\red{Q:} Do you think Jesus thought of Abram?

\red{Q:} Aren't you glad the writer to the Hebrews reminds us:
\begin{quotation}
$^{15}$For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. $^{15}$Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. [Heb~4:15--16, ESV]
\end{quotation}

\subsection{Summary of Abram's call}
We see that there were many barriers that caused Abram to delay
in obeying God's call. Yet in the end, he did obey.

The Apostle Paul gives us this summary:
  
\begin{quotation}
  $^{1}$What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather
  according to the flesh? $^{2}$For if Abraham was justified by works,
  he has something to boast about, but not before God. $^{3}$For what
  does the Scripture say? ``Abraham believed God, and it was counted
  to him as righteousness.'' [Ro 4:1â€“3 citing Gen 15:6, ESV].
\end{quotation}

And the writer to the Hebrews gives us this summary:

\begin{quotation}
  $^{8}$By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place
  that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing
  where he was going. [Heb~11:8, ESV]
\end{quotation}

\section{Fear and snares}

As a real person, Abram faced fears and snares. We see several in
Gen~12--13. We will see others in subsequent weeks as Abram awaits the
promised heir. Let's briefly examine the ones we find in Gen~11--13.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Family entanglements in Ur and Haran (Gen 11:28-12:4)
  \item Deception of Pharaoh regarding relationship with Sarai
  (Gen 12:10-20)
  \item Strife with Lot over water/pasture (Gen 13:1-13)
\end{itemize}

\section{Acts of faith}

As a believer, we will see Abram show many acts of faith. We have already
seen him move his family toward the promised land. There is another act of
faith in Gen 13, after Abram separates from Lot, whom we shall later see has
questionable judgement.

\begin{quotation}
$^{14}$The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, ``Lift
up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and
southward and eastward and westward, $^{15}$for all the land that you
see I will give to you and to your offspring forever. $^{16}$I will make
your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the
dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted. $^{17}$Arise,
walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it
to you.'' $^{18}$\red{So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by
the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to
the LORD}. [Ge~13:14--18, ESV]
\end{quotation}


\section{Summary}
We see Abram presented as a real person with real fears and
all the problems that come up in a human life. He was a sinner
in need of cleansing, ultimately with the shed blood of Christ.
He believed God's revelation, and and ultimately obeyed. On that basis
God declared him righteous and used him to father the line from which
Christ would be born.

Next time we will cover Abram, Melchizedek, and the covenant from
Gen 14--15. Please feel free to read ahead.
